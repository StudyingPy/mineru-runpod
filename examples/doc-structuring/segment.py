"""Assign a flat MinerU block stream to sections, in document reading order.

The core is a single forward walk: each block belongs to the section whose heading most
recently appeared. Because boundaries are only ever set by a real heading, a section can
never steal a neighbour's content (the failure mode of page/position heuristics).

You inject `heading_id(block) -> section_id | None`. That callback is where your
domain lives: match a numbered heading, a styled `text_level` line, a code-caption that
holds a heading, an annex title, etc. Keep it precise — false headings fragment content.
